- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## More Info
You will be asked to write files containing big O notations. Please use this format:
- `O(1)`
- `O(n)`
- `O(n!)`
- n * m -> - `O(nm)`
- n square -> `O(n^2)`
- sqrt n -> `O(sqrt(n))`
- log(n) -> `O(log(n))`
- n * log(n) -> `O(nlog(n))`
- ...
